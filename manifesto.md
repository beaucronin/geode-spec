Our relationship with data must change. In the current era, pervasive data collection is put to two main uses: generating profit via targeted marketing and information arbitrage, and consolidating state power via surveillance and the social control it enables. Both of these applications are built and operated to serve the interests of the largest entities on earth: national governments and large corporations. Given these controlling interests, it is not surprising that these systems rely on significant centralization: for their ends to be achieved, the data must flow through choke points, the means of its collection must be tightly controlled, or both. 

Many efforts are underway to loosen the stranglehold of private companies on the collection of personal data for marketing purposes. Much less is being done to address the other uses of mass surveillance: the collection of enormous datasets to profit from information asymmetries, and the wielding of data in the service of state control over the populace.

We therefore embark on a mission to build sousveillance networks that are as powerful as the surveillance systems that we live under today. And: our means of production – the orchestration and integration of crowd-gathered observation – will match and surpass the capabilities of state power and centralized private capital. Sousveillance is a weapon of the weak, but in this new era the weak become strong by knitting their efforts together. We are not a mob, but a swarm, a hive, a colony.

There is danger in gathering knowledge of the physical systems, both natural and built, that comprise our environment. Bottlenecks and vulnerabilities can be identified that are otherwise shielded by obscurity. 

Pushing back hard against the received wisdom - which serves centralized authority - that comprehensive observations of the world are a threat to security because they will be used by those who would do harm.


1. Rebalancing economic and political power from centralized states and corporate capital to the edges of society. Reducing information gradients on a global scale is a key lever in reducing inequality at that same scale.
2. Creating a sensory system for our civilization that allows it to respond to pain, route around injury, and foresee and avoid dangers. No complex system, and certainly no organism, can persist without and appropriate means of perceiving its environment.
3. Providing the underpinnings of more resilient modes of social organization. In systems terms, this change in paradigm can increase the strength of negative feedback loops, shorten the delays in perceiving the effects of actions, and reduce the strength of positive feedback loops.




Both corporatist and libertarian perspectives leave many people without a safety net; one because it views individuals as resources, the other because in its search for individual liberties it is willing to jettison the institutions and public goods that can prevent so much misery - yet are produced via the mechanisms of state coercion.

Anarchism has no compelling theory of scale; even if the mechanisms of mutual aid and solidarity can be applied everywhere, there are no 

A question arises: how can we create social systems that put the quality of human experience, including future humans' experiences, at the center of their aims, while not relying on the coercive mechanisms of government - mechanisms which, in practice, are subject to capture by large corporate interests? Our argument is that we do not know which systems of social and political organization will become true once new forms of knowledge and information goods are created and disseminated - but we do hypothesize that the competitive balance between systems can be shifted enough to create new stable points.

Two basic forces that can realistically be wielded to drive non-coercive collective action:

- Memetic dispersion: culture, entertainment, accumulation of social status
- Market incentives: rewarding actions that, in aggregate, lead to a greater good

Systems theory can be applied to social change. Donella Meadows' classificrankingation of the leverage points in systems chage provides a solid jumping off point. We focus our attention on her sixth lever: changes in the structure and content of information flows within the different elements of a system. In particular, we ask what might the systemic effects of new modes of information dissemination be? 

Society has been repeatedly reshaped by new forms of information dissemination - from the printing press to broadcast media to the various iterations of internet-mediated communication to the current area of social media dominance.
